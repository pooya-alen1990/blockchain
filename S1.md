Ethereum vs Bitcoin

Fork in Blockchain
- Soft Fork(Backward Compatible)
- Hard Fork(Not BC) --> BitcoinCash is Hard Fork of Bitcoin

Forks in Ethereum
- 2015 Frontier(Hard)
- 2016 Homestead(Hard - Current Fork)
- 2016 Dao(Hard Fork Unplanned) --> Ethereum Classic & Ethereum
- 2016 Tangerine (Soft)
- 2016 (Fullnode Ethereum is GETH) 
- 2017 Metropolis(Hard)
- 2017 Selenity(Hard) --> proof of work change to proof of concept

Consensus Algorithm
- Proof of Work
- Proof of Stake
- Delegated Proof of Stake
